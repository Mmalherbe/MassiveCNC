# MassiveCNC

MassiveCNC is an utility that allows CNC machine users to do generate G-code from text, SVG or precompiled G-Code. Or interact with their machine in RealTime using Unity3D.

Currently only works with EdingCNC controllers, but open to other controllers (Will need to be implemented).

## Sidenote
The project can currently:
- Generate Gcode from Text (Windows fonts or SVG fonts) *
- Generate Gcode from SVG including layers
- Process and edit pregenerated Gcode

* Not all Windows fonts may work propperly due to the way they are built and converted using GraphicsPath.AddString()

## TODO
- Fix windows fonts not working properly
- Bugfix the connection between EdingCNC, being unable to connect when starting the project
- Find a gorgeous UI 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the Unity3D ( Tested and developed on 2019.4, may work on others).
* You have a Windows or Mac machine, Windows is needed in order to interact with the EdingCNC software.

```
Open the cloned or forked version in Unity3D.

(optional) for the connection with EdingCNC
Make sure to install EdingCNC 4.03
In the hierarchy under controllers select the cncapi_controller and set the EdingCNCPath correctly ( To the cnc.ini in the installed location of EdingCNC4.03)

For example : C:\Users\M\Desktop\CNC4.03\cnc.ini
 Start the EdingCNC4.03 as administrator and select the blue start button. Afterwards you should be able to connect to EdingCNC.
